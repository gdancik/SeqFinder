# Assignment #2:

# write a script that reads in a results file from the
# match script, and for each sequence, finds the top BLAST hit.

# Create a new file that copies the original input file and adds the
# following columns: the definition (.hit_def).

# Then for the first high-scoring pair (from topHit.hsps), get the alignment
# length and the percent identity (the number of identities / the alignment
# length).

# This script should take two arguments â€“ the input file name and
# output file name. An example BLAST script is below:
